# SSL Orchestrator Consolidated Services Architecture (UDF Version)
A Docker Compose configuration to create all of the SSLO security services on a single Ubuntu 18.04 instance, to both simplify and dramatically reduce resource utlization in a virtual environment.

### About
This Docker Compose configuration supports the **F5 UDF** demo environment, which itself supports 802.1Q VLAN tags. This also reduces the number of physical interfaces and connections required.
